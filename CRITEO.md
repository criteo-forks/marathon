### Criteo patching branches

Criteo branches should be named `criteo/X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` references the Marathon version at branching point.

Criteo versions are named after the following model: `vX.Y.Z-criteoP` where `X.Y.Z` is the marathon version at branching point, and `P` the Criteo patches increment.
